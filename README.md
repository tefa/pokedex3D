## Files and Data
MySQL database and cries are based from veekun's work (https://github.com/veekun/pokedex)
Pokémon cries are available in mp3, ogg and wav to be supported by the most of browsers (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats)
3D models come from models-resource (http://www.models-resource.com/) and SketchUp (https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com), I used Blender to convert 3D models in x3d format

## Adding a Model
You can add your own model in x3d format by copying in x3d folder. The filename must be the Pokémon number and textures must be stored in x3d/textures folder
